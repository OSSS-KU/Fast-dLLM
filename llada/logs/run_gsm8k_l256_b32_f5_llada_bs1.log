answer:  Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.
She bakes 4 her for her friends every day, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.
She sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 per day.
Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

answer:  To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to add the amount of blue fiber and the amount of white fiber.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
It also takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

So, the total number of bolts needed is:
2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts.

Therefore, the robe takes a total of 3 bolts.

The discounted price of one glass is 60% of $5, so 8 glasses at the discounted price will cost 8 * $3 = $24.
Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $40 + $24 = $64 in total.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she had 1/3x - 1 left.
We know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so 1/3x - 1 = 5.

Next, calculate the distance each train travels on the second day:
- On the second day, each train travels 150 miles northward.

Now, add the distances from both days to find the total distance covered by each train:
- Total distance = 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

Therefore, each train covers a total distance of 230 miles in the two days.

To find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance to the first stop from the distance to the second stop:

Distance between first and second stops = Distance to second stop - Distance to first stop
Distance between first and second stops = 15 miles - 20 miles = 5 miles before second stop

So, Henry traveled 5 miles between his first and second stops.

answer:  The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second friend guesses 20 more than half the first one, which is 80/2 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.
The third friend guesses 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + 0.25*80 = 100 jelly beans.
The average guess is (80 + 100 + 100) / 3 = 280 / 3 = 93 jelly beans.

answer:  John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Therefore, in one day, John spends:

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

To find out how many hours he spends in a week, we multiply the daily hours by the number of days in a week:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs.

answer:  Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \).
The number of gold coins would then be \( S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is 110, so:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, the number of gold coins is \( 40 + 30 = 70 \] gold coins.

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, add the points from both periods to find the total:

If Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, selling 20 candles will bring in 20 * $2 = $40.

answer:  If there are 60 girls, then the number of boys is 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120.
The total number of students in the school is 60 girls + 120 boys = <<60+120=180>>180 students.
If there are 5 students to every teacher, then the number of teachers is 180 / 5 = <<180/5=36>>36.
Therefore, there are 36 teachers.

answer:  Bailey starts with a certain amount of money and receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100.

To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount she received from the total amount she has at the end.

Total amount received = $5/week * 8 weeks = $40

Amount Bailey started with = $100 - $40 = $60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60.

answer:  The original cost of the grooming is $100. The groomer offers a 30% discount. To find the discounted price, we first calculate the amount of the discount:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final cost:

\[ \text{Final cost} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

\[ \text{Cookies's cookies} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, add the number of cookies each person eats to find the total:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Amir's cookies} + \text{Cody's cookies} = 5 + 15 = 20 \]

So, Cody and Amir eat a total of 20 cookies together.

answer:  The inner dimensions of each box are (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, which is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.
The volume of one box is 3 inches x 4 inches x 2 inches = <<3*4*2=24>>24 cubic inches.
Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 24 cubic inches/box x 3 boxes = <<24*3=72>>72 cubic inches.

answer:  On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.
On Thursday, he watched 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours.
On Friday, he watched 2 hours.
In total, Frankie watched 2 hours + 1.5 hours + 2 hours = 5.5 hours.
Since he watched 7 hours in total, he must have watched 7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours on Wednesday.
Therefore, he watched 3 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

answer:  Let x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
He wanted to make twice as many as he did last year, so he made 2x cookies.
He actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he made 2x + 15 cookies.
He dropped 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 cookies.
Solving for x, we get 2x = 100, so x = 50.
Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

answer:  The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.
The app company offers $0.20 per gallon in cashback, so for 10 gallons, the total cashback is 10 * $0.20 = $2.00.
Therefore, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $30.00 - $2.00 = $<<30-2=28>>28.00.

answer:  It took Julia sixteen seconds to row twenty feet, so in sixteen seconds she would row 20/16 = 2.5 feet.
In 64 seconds, she would row 64/2.5 = 256 feet.
The boat takes on two liters of water for every ten feet rowed, so in 256 feet, it would take on 256/10 * 2 = 51.2 liters of water.
Therefore, the boat had taken on 51.2 liters of water.

answer:  Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. Therefore, the total number of lessons per day is 2 lessons/teacher * 4 teachers = 8 lessons/day.

In each lesson, the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times. So, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 lessons/day * 3 times/lesson = 24 times/day.

Thus, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

Next, subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted:

\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

So, after 15 days, Ryan has 25 flowers that have successfully grown.

If the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo, then the number of birds in the photograph is 300/50 = 6.
Therefore, Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo can show 6 ducks in total.

Next, calculate the number of teaspoons per part by dividing the total number of teaspoons by the total number of parts: 120 teaspoons / 20 parts = 6 teaspoons per part.

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 7 parts. Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 7 parts * 6 teaspoons per part = 42 teaspoons.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30, so the number of vehicles added on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20.
Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers added on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.
Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4 - 2 = 2.

Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, Miguel uses:

So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

Jennie put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps:
60 letters * 1/3 = 20 letters

Next, subtract the number of stamped letters from the total number of letters needing stamps:
60 letters - 20 letters = 40 letters

Now, add the number of letters currently in the already-stamped pile to the number of letters that were not stamped:
40 letters + 30 letters = 70 letters

Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew and then had 5 more spoons from her husband, making a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Julia bought 10 spoons in the initial package.

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages.
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages:
38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82 sausages in total.

Therefore, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages.
