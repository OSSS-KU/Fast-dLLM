answer:  Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

The remaining eggs are 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

She sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 per day.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

She has already given her chickens 15 cups in the morning + 25 cups in the afternoon = <<15+25=40>>40 cups of feed.
Therefore, she needs to give her chickens 60 cups - 40 cups = <<60-40=20>>20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

He then spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during that time.
He spends the next half-hour driving at 30 mph, so he covers 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.
Finally, he drives the remaining 1 hour at 80 mph, so he covers 1 * 80 = 80 miles.
Therefore, John is 275 miles from home.

However, he will also spend $3 each year to water and feed the tree.
So, he will earn $10 - $3 = $7 each year.
To earn money on the lemon tree, Carlos needs to cover the initial cost of planting the tree.
He needs to earn $90, and he earns $7 each year.
So, it will take him $90 / $7 = 13 years to cover the initial cost.

She sold 2 more at the red house, so she had 2/3x - 2 left.
She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she had 1/3x - 1 left.
We know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so 1/3x - 1 = 5.

answer:  To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to add the distances traveled on each day.

On the first day, each train travels 80 miles westward.
On the second day, each train travels 150 miles northward.

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:

80 miles (first day) + 150 miles (second day) = 230 miles

Therefore, each train covers a total distance of 230 miles in the two days.

answer:  Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.

To find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop:

\[ 15 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 5 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Henry traveled 5 miles between his first and second stops.

\[ 5 \text{ miles} \]

answer:  Let B be the cost of the boots.
The first pair of heels costs $33.
The second pair of heels costs 2 * $33 = $66.
The total cost of the heels is $33 + $66 = $99.
According to the problem, the total cost of the heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots.
So, $99 = B - $5.
Adding $5 to both sides, we get B = $104.
Therefore, the boots cost $104.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, John spends:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs.

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is 110, so:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins is also 40.

answer:  To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of one movie visit and then divide his total budget by that amount.

The cost of one movie ticket is $7, and the cost of popcorn is also $7. Therefore, the total cost for one movie visit is $7 + $7 = $14.

Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we divide $42 by $14:

$42 / $14 = 3

answer:  The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds, so the remaining weight that the truck can carry is 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.
Each box weighs 15 pounds, so the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 1245 / 15 = 83 boxes.
Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

First, calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters:
\[ 6 \text{ clusters} \times 20 \text{ fruit per cluster} = 120 \text{ raspberries} \]

Next, add the individual raspberries scattered across the bush:
\[ 120 + 67 = 187 \]

So, the total number of raspberries is \( \boxed{187} \).

answer:  Out of the 25 oranges, 1 is bad, 20% are unripe, which is 20/100 * 25 = 5 unripe oranges, and 2 are sour.

So, the total number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges is 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges.

Therefore, the number of good oranges is the total number of oranges minus the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges, which is 25 - 8 = 17 good oranges.

The total value of her pension after 30 years would be $50,000/year * 30 years = $1,500,000.

Since she is entitled to 5% of this value per year, her annual pension would be $1,500,000 * 5% = $75,000.

Therefore, her annual pension would be $75,000.

At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Subtracting 40 from both sides:

\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

answer:  Let's denote the number of games lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games won is \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team won \( 15 \) games.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3*4 = 12 times.
The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12/2 = 6 times.
In total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.

The total number of copies sold by both is given by:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]
\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold \(\boxed{8000}\) copies of his record.

answer:  Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them don't show up. So, 16 * (1/4) = 4 friends don't show up.

Therefore, 16 - 4 = 12 friends actually show up.

Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, so she needs 12 * 0.75 = 9 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2, so she will spend 9 * $2 = $18 on gift bags.

Christina will spend $18.

answer:  Harry slept 9 hours last night. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept. 

To find out how many hours James slept, we calculate 2/3 of Harry's sleep:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James's sleep from Harry's sleep:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

answer:  When Freda cooks the tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Therefore, the volume of the sauce is twice the volume of the original tomatoes.

Given that the volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, the original volume of the tomatoes must be 32 / 2 = 16 ounces.

Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, Freda used 16 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 1 can of tomatoes.

So, Freda used 1 can of tomatoes, which contains a total of 3 tomatoes.

5 cars took an exit, so there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars left in the traffic jam.
In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through, and in the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes must be 25 - 20 = 5 cars.
Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

The city is 42 miles across, and it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles.

So, we divide the total distance by the time per 3 miles:

42 miles / 3 miles * 10 minutes per 3 miles = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take the fog bank 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

He wanted to make twice as many as he did last year, so he made 2x cookies.

He baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he made 2x + 15 cookies.

He dropped 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 cookies left.

Solving for x, we get 2x = 100, so x = 50.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

answer:  Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and the whiteboard is used in each lesson. Therefore, each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times per day.

Since there are 4 teachers, the total number of times the whiteboard is used in a day is:
4 teachers * 2 times per teacher per day = 8 times per day.

If the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times it is cleaned in a day is:
8 times per day * 3 times per lesson = 24 times per day.

answer:  First, find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

Next, find out how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph. Since the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph, the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6 ducks.

answer:  The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13.
The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.
Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water.
So, each part of the ratio represents 120 / 20 = 6 teaspoons.
Since the ratio of teaspoons of sugar is 7 parts, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons.
Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar in her coffee.

answer:  Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. Therefore, he uses:

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

To find out how many sheets he uses in a month, we need to multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, we get:

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so he brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
He also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so he brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.
Therefore, Kael has a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.
Together, they have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits in total.

answer:  Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

Julia's husband gave her 5 spoons, and she used 3 spoons to sample the stew. After using these spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package of spoons that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

Joseph's expenditure in May was $500.
In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May, so his expenditure in June was:

$500 - $60 = $440

Now, we add the expenditures for May and June to find the total expenditure:

$500 + $440 = $940

Therefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June was:
