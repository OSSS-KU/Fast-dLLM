answer:  Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends using 4 eggs. Therefore, she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

The remaining eggs are 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

She sells these eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs each day is 9 * $2 = $18.

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

answer:  To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to add the amount of blue fiber to the amount of white fiber.

Given:
- The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The amount of white fiber is half the amount of blue fiber, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt.

Now, we add the amounts of blue fiber and white fiber:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \]

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]

First, calculate the total distance he runs in one week:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters per week

Since he does this 3 times a week, multiply the distance for one week by the number of times he runs it in a week:
180 meters per week * 3 times per week = 540 meters per week

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters a week.

answer:  Each year, Carlos will earn 7 * $1.5 = $10 from selling lemons.
Each year, he will spend $3 on water and feeding.
So, each year, he will earn $10 - $3 = $7.
To start earning money, he needs to cover the initial cost of $90.
Since he earns $7 per year, it will take him $90 / $7 = 13 years to cover the initial cost.
Therefore, it will take Carlos 13 years to start earning money on the initial investment in the lemon tree.

answer:  For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles, so 20 candles will require 2 pounds of beeswax.
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.
If Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, his revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.
His net profit is revenue minus cost, so $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

answer:  To determine how many pieces of wire Tracy obtained, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches.
Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Step 2: Determine how many pieces of wire can be obtained by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece.
We divide 48 inches by 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.

Therefore, Tracy obtained \boxed{8} pieces.

answer:  Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he used to be 2 seconds faster than Gerald, then Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.
After Gerald changed his diet, his speed improved by 10%, so he can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 * 1.10 = 36 seconds.
Therefore, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

answer:  Harry slept 9 hours last night. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept. 

To find out how many hours James James slept, we can multiply Harry's sleep by 2/3:

James's sleep = 9 hours * (2/3) = 6 hours

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James's sleep from Harry's sleep:

Difference = Harry's sleep - James's sleep = 9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

Therefore, Harry slept for 3 more hours than James.

answer:  When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Therefore, the 32 ounces of sauce came from 64 ounces of tomatoes. 

Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. So, to find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of each can:

64 ounces of tomatoes / 16 ounces per can = 3 tomatoes per can

Therefore, Freda used 3 tomatoes per can * 4 cans = 12 tomatoes in her last batch of tomato sauce.

42 miles / 3 miles per segment = 14 segments

Since each segment takes 10 minutes to cover, we multiply the number of segments by the time per segment:

14 segments * 10 minutes per segment = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take the fog bank 140 minutes to cover the entire 42-mile-wide city.

However, he baked 15 more than he meant to, so he baked 2x + 15 cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 cookies. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = 100. Divide both sides by 2, we get x = 50. So Henry baked 50 cookies last year.
