answer:  Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

The remainder of the eggs is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

She sells each egg for $2, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 per day from selling the eggs.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

answer:  The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. 

First, calculate the amount of white fiber:
- Half of 2 bolts of blue fiber is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Next, add the amount of blue fiber to the amount of white fiber:
- Blue fiber: 2 bolts
- White fiber: 1 bolt

Total bolts of fiber:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \] bolts.

So, the robe takes a total of 3 bolts of fiber.

The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is $130,000 * 1.5 = $195,000.
The profit is the difference between the new value and the original price, so it is $195,000 - $80,000 = $115,000.

The cost of each pair of glasses is $5 + $5 = $10.
Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, the cost of every second glass is $5 * 0.6 = $3.
So, the total cost for each pair of glasses is $10 - $3 = $7.
Therefore, Kylar needs to pay 8 * $7 = $56.

However, 40% of the way through the download, she has to restart, which takes 20 minutes.

He then spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during that time.
He spends the next half-hour driving at 30 mph, so he covers 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.
Finally, he drives the remaining 1 hour at 80 mph, so he covers 1 * 80 = 80 miles.
In total, John is 275 miles away.

answer:  To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to add the distances traveled on each day.

On the first day, each train travels 80 miles westward.
On the second day, each train travels 150 miles northward.

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:

80 miles (first day) + 150 miles (second day) = 230 miles.

Therefore, each train covers a total distance of 230 miles in the two days.

answer:  Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will eat 60 servings.
Each carton contains 15 servings, so she will need 60 / 15 = 4 cartons of ice cream.
Each carton costs $4.00, so she will spend 4 * $4.00 = $16.00 on ice cream.

answer:  Henry made his first stop after 20 miles and his second stop 15 miles before the end of his trip. The total distance of his trip is 60 miles.

To find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance to the first stop and the distance to the second stop from the total distance:

60 miles (total distance) - 20 miles (first stop) - 15 miles (second stop) = 25 miles

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

answer:  Let B be the cost of the boots.
The first pair of heels costs $33.
The second pair of heels costs 2 * $33 = $66.
The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.
According to the problem, the total cost of the heels is $5 less than the boots.
So, $99 = B - $5.
Adding $5 to both sides, we get B = $104.
Therefore, the boots cost $104.

answer:  The total ratio of their ages is 7 + 11 = 18.
Each part of the ratio represents 162 / 18 = 9 years.
Allen's current age is 11 parts, which is 11 * 9 = 99 years.
In 10 years, Allen's age will be 99 + 10 = 109 years.

answer:  The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second friend says 20 more than half the first one, which is 80/2 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.
The third friend says 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + 25% of 80 = 100 jelly beans.
To find the average guess, we add up all the guesses and divide by 3: (80 + 100 + 100) / 3 = 90.

answer:  John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Therefore, the total daily time spent taking care of the dogs is:

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

To find out how many hours a week he spends taking care of the dogs, we multiply the daily time by the number of days in a week:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.

answer:  Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \).

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is 110, so:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins is also 40.

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 40/2 + 5 = <<40/2+5=25>>25 jewels.
Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = <<25-2=23>>23 jewels.

answer:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes.
To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25: 4 * 0.25 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.
In total, Mike scores 4 + 5 = 9 points in the 40 minutes.
The answer is 9

answer:  Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so he eats 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts in 30 days.
The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, so each yogurt costs $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.
Therefore, Terry spends 60 x $1.25 = $<<60*1.25=75.00>>75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.
