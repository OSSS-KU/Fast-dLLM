answer:  Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends using 4 eggs. Therefore, she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

The remaining eggs are 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

She sells these eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs each day is 9 * $2 = $18.

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

answer:  To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber.

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it takes \( 2 / 2 = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \]

Therefore, the robe takes a total of 3 bolts.

3 sprints per time * 3 times per week = 9 sprints per week

Next, to find the total distance James runs in a week, we multiply the number of sprints per week by the distance of each sprint:

9 sprints per week * 60 meters per sprint = 540 meters per week

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters per week.

However, he will spend $3 each year on watering and feeding the tree, so his net earnings each year will be $10 - $3 = $7.
To start earning money, Carlos needs to cover the initial cost of planting the tree, which is $90.
Since he earns $7 each year, it will take him $90 / $7 = 13 years to cover the initial cost and start earning money on the lemon tree.

On the first day, each train travels 80 miles westward.

On the second day, each train travels 150 miles northward.

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:

80 miles (first day) + 150 miles (second day) = 230 miles

Therefore, each train covers a total distance of 230 miles in the two days.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

To convert eggs to dozens, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen):

84 eggs / 12 = 7 dozens.

Therefore, Claire will eat **7** dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a span of-hour period.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, the total reduction in length will be:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning for 4 hours.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = $19.50 / 0.75

answer:  Siobhan has 18 jewels.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Half of Raymond's jewels is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
3. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has \( 20 + 5 = 25 \) jewels.
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has \( 25 - 2 = 23 \) jewels.

answer:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Total points = 4 + 5 points.

answer:  Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.
The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, so Terry will need 60 / 4 = 15 sets of 4 yogurts.
Each set costs $5.00, so Terry will spend 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The answer is $75.00.

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends 8 * $20 = $160.
He has $5 left, so he spent $195 - $160 - $5 = $30 on video games.
Since he sells lego sets for $15 each, he still has $30 / $15 = 2 lego sets left.

answer:  John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week, so he runs a total of 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles per day.

He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days, so he runs 3 hours + 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours per day.

To find his running speed, we divide the distance he runs by the time it takes him to run that distance:

20 miles / 4.5 hours = 4.444 miles per hour.

If you have already consumed 1800 calories and your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, you can consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories more.

Since each serving has 50 calories, you can eat 200/50 = 4 servings of chips, which corresponds to 200 grams.

answer:  Shiela will pay $150 x 5 = $750 for the 5 cell phones.
The interest for each cell phone is $150 x 2/100 = $3.
So, the total amount for each cell phone is $150 + $3 = $153.
Since there are 5 cell phones, the total amount to be paid is $153 x 5 = $765.
Therefore, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $255 each month for 3 months.

answer:  To determine the final cost after the discount, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the amount of the discount.
The discount is 30% of the original price of $100.
\[ \text{Discount} = 0.30 \times 100 = 30 \]

Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price.
\[ \text{Final Price} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, the cost of the grooming is \(\boxed{70}\).

1/6 * 24 = 4 liters

So, each girl got 4 liters, and together they got 8 liters.

Next, we subtract the water taken by the girls and the boy from the total amount:

24 liters - 8 liters (girls) - 6 liters (boy) = 10 liters

Therefore, the total number of liters of water left is 10 liters.

Each set of 20 feet is 20 x 4 = 80 feet.
The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed, so for 80 feet, the boat takes on 2 x (80/10) = 16 liters of water.
Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore.

answer:  Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. Therefore, the total number of lessons per day is 2 lessons/teacher * 4 teachers = 8 lessons/day.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. So, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 lessons/day * 3 times/lesson = 24 times/day.

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

answer:  To determine how many flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he plants and then account for the flowers that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers each day. Over 15 days, he plants:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ flowers} \]

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. Therefore, the number of flowers that grew is:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

So, Ryan has 25 flowers after the given period.

answer:  Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, Brittany's phone can hold 1800/6 = 300 photographs.
The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo, so the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300/50 = 6.
Therefore, 6 ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

answer:  The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water.

The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water.

So, each part of the ratio represents 120 / 20 = 6 teaspoons.

Since there are 7 parts of sugar, Katy used 7*6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

answer:  On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, making a total of 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers added on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4 containers.

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\).

answer:  Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. Therefore, he uses:

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

To find out how many sheets he uses every month, we need to know the number of weeks in a month. Let's assume a month has 4 weeks for simplicity.

So, Miguel uses:

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.
So, Kael brought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

Therefore, the total number of fruits is 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.

answer:  Jennie started with 60 letters needing stamps and put stamps on one-third of them. This means she put stamps on 60/3 = 20 letters.

After putting stamps on 20 letters, she still has 60 - 20 = 40 letters needing stamps.

If there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters now, then before putting stamps on the letters needing stamps, there were 30 letters in the pile.

Therefore, Jennie began with **30 letters** in the pile of already-stamped letters.

answer:  Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

According to the problem, Julia had \( x \) spoons initially, received 5 more spoons from her husband, and then used 3 spoons. Finally, she ended up with 12 spoons.

So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Julia initially bought 10 spoons.
