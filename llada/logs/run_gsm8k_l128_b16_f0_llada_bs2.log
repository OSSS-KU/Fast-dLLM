answer:  Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends using 4 eggs. Therefore, she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

The remaining eggs are 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

She sells these eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. So, the total amount she makes every day is:

9 eggs * $2/egg = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

answer:  To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to add the amount of blue fiber to the amount of white fiber.

Given:
- The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The amount of white fiber is half the amount of blue fiber.

So, the amount of white fiber is:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt} \]

Now, we add the blue and white fibers:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \]

Therefore, the robe takes 3 bolts in total.

answer:  To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we need to calculate the distance he runs in one session and then multiply by the number of sessions he runs in a week.

1. James runs 3 sprints per session.
2. Each sprint is 60 meters.
3. Therefore, one session is 3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters.
4. James runs 3 times a week.

So, the total distance James runs in a week is 180 meters * 3 sessions = 540 meters.

However, he will spend $3 each year on watering and feeding the tree, so his net earnings each year will be $10 - $3 = $7.
To start earning money, Carlos needs to cover the initial cost of planting the tree, which is $90.
Since he earns $7 each year, it will take him $90 / $7 = 13 years to cover the initial cost and start earning money on the lemon tree.

Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.
Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.
Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

answer:  When Polly holds the sapphire gem gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Therefore, with the gemstone, she can throw the javelin 3 \times 400 = 1200 feet.

The dragon's flames can reach a distance of 1000 feet. Thus, with the gemstone, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon.

Answer: 200 feet.

answer:  To determine how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of pie available:
   - Each pie is cut into 8 pieces.
   - There are 5 pies.
   - Total pieces = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.

2. Subtract the number of pieces remaining from the total number of pieces:
   - Pieces remaining = 14 pieces.
   - Pieces taken by guests = 40 pieces - 14 = 26 pieces.

answer:  Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, you can consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories more.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, you can consume 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings of chips.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, you can eat 0.8 / 5 * 300 = 48 grams of chips without exceeding your calorie limit.

answer:  For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles, so 20 candles will require 2 pounds of beeswax.
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.
If Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, his revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.
His net profit is revenue minus cost, so $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches/foot.
4 \times 12 = 48 inches

Step 2: Divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece in inches.

answer:  To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing.
   - Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old.
   - He is now 34 years old.
   - Number of years = 34 - 23 = 11 years.

2. Since each vacation is a unique quilt block, the number of quilt blocks is equal to the number of years he has been vacationing.

Therefore, Gene has 11 total quilt blocks.

answer:  The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times. In total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.

answer:  Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month. After 5 years of service, her salary will increase by 10% of $600, which is $600 * 0.10 = $60. Therefore, her new salary will be $600 + $60 = $660 per month.

To find her annual salary, we multiply her monthly salary by 12: $660 * 12 = $7920.

So, Sylvie's annual salary will be $7920.

Combining like terms, we get 11H = 88,000. Dividing both sides by 11, we find H = 8,000. Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

Therefore, 16 - 4 = 12 friends will show up.

She needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, so she needs 12 * 0.75 = 9 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2, so she will spend 9 * $2 = $18.

Christina will spend $18 on the gift bags.

Each child will eat half as much as an adult, so 5 children will eat 5 * (10/2) = 25 pounds.
To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount eaten by the adults and the children: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.
Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to feed everyone.

To find out how many hours James James slept, we multiply Harry's sleep by 2/3:

James's sleep = 9 hours * (2/3) = 6 hours

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James's sleep from Harry's sleep:

Difference in sleep = Harry's sleep - James's sleep = 9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. So, to find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of each can:

64 ounces of tomatoes / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, Freda used:

4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes

answer:  Each watermelon costs 3*15 = 45$. An orange costs 45-5 = 40$. Dillon will buy 4*45 = 180$ on watermelons, 20*15 = 300$ on peppers, and 10*40 = 400$ on oranges. The total amount of money he will spend is 180+300+400 = 880$.

answer:  Each patient is seen for 24/60=$0.4 hours
So each patient pays 0.4*200=$80
So the hospital makes 500*80=$40000 from patients
The doctors cost 500*150=$75000
So their profit is 40000-75000=$-35000
The answer is -35000

answer:  First, we need to determine how many elves quit after children vomit on them. A third of 60 is:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

So, 20 elves quit, leaving:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of elves left is:

\[ \boxed{30}\]

answer:  To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we need to calculate his expenditure for each month and then add them together.

In May, Joseph's expenditure was $500.

In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May. Therefore, his expenditure in June was:
$500 - $60 = $440

Now, we add the expenditures for May and June together:
$500 + $440 = $940

So, Joseph's total expenditure for both May and June was $940.
