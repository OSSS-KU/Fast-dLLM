answer:  Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

The remaining eggs are 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

She sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 per day.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

answer:  The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. 

To find the total number of bolts, we add the amount of blue fiber to the amount of white fiber:

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: half of 2 bolts, which is 1 bolt

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
Total bolts = 2 bolts + 1 bolt
Total bolts = 3 bolts

Therefore, the robe takes a total of 3 bolts.

answer:  Grandma Jones cut 5 apple pies into 8 pieces each, so she had a total of 5 pies * 8 pieces/pie = <<5*8=40>>40 pieces of pie.
At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining, so the guests' pieces taken were 40 pieces - 14 pieces = <<40-14=26>>26 pieces.
Therefore, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.

answer:  A bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, so 5 servings x 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.
If your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, you can consume 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories more.
Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, you can eat 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings of chips.

answer:  For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 candles, so 20 candles will require 20/10 = 2 pounds of beeswax.
One pound of beeswax costs $10.00, so 2 pounds will cost 2*$10 = $20.00.
He sells each candle for $2.00, so 20 candles will bring in 20*$2 = $40.00.
His total profit is $40-$20 = $20.00.

4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}

Next, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces:

48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces}

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

To remove the remaining weight, he needs to remove 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is 7.5 pounds / 1/2 = 15 toys.

answer:  Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them don't show up. So, 16 * (1/4) = 4 friends don't show up.

She needs 16 - 4 = 12 friends who actually show up.

She needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, so she needs 12 * 0.75 = 9 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2, so she will spend 9 * $2 = $18.

Therefore, Christina will spend $18.

answer:  Each adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, so 20 adults will eat 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.
Each child will eat half as much as an adult, so 5 children will eat 5 * (10/2) = 25 lbs.
In total, the adults and children will eat 200 + 25 = 225 lbs of potato salad.
Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic to have enough to feed everyone.

answer:  Harry slept 9 hours last night. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept. 

First, we need to calculate how many hours James slept:
\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we find the difference in the number of hours they slept:
\[ \text{Difference} = 9 \text{ hours} - 6 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

The city is 42 miles across, and it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles.

So, we divide 42 miles by 3 miles per 10 minutes:

42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes = 14 sets

Therefore, it will take 14 10-minute intervals for the fog bank to cover the entire city.
