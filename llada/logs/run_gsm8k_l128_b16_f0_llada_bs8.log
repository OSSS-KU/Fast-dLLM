answer:  Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends using 4 eggs. Therefore, she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

The remaining eggs are 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

She sells these eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs each day is 9 * $2 = $18.

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

answer:  To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to add the amount of blue fiber to the amount of white fiber.

Given:
- The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The amount of white fiber is half the amount of blue fiber, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber and the amount of white fiber:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \]

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is \(\boxed{3} \).

answer:  To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we need to calculate the distance he runs in one session and then multiply by the number of sessions he runs in a week.

1. James runs 3 sprints per session.
2. Each sprint is 60 meters.
3. Therefore, one session = 3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters.
4. James runs 3 times a week.
5. So, the total distance in a week = 180 meters.session * 3 sessions = 540 meters.

However, he will spend $3 each year on watering and feeding the tree, so his net earnings each year will be $10 - $3 = $7.
To cover the initial cost of planting the tree, Carlos will need to earn $90.
Since his net earnings each year are $7, it will take him $90 / $7 = 13 years to earn enough money to cover the initial cost of planting the tree.

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a period of 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, over 4 hours, it will melt by:

2 centimeters/hour * 4 hours = 8 centimeters

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after this period.

She also purchased a package of Post-it notes, so the total number of Post-it notes she had is 80 + 197 = 277.
Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package is 277 - 80 = 197.

He spent $200 on blue ties and $6000 on red ties, so he spent a total of $200 + $6000 = $6200 on ties.

answer:  First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 4 feet by 12:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Next, we need to determine how many pieces of 6 inches each can be obtained from the 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then the number of occupied units is (3/4) * 120 units = 90 units.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

120 units - 90 units = 30 unoccupied units.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30.

So, there are 200 - 80 = 120 girls in Grade 5.
Out of the 120 girls, 2/3 = 80 girls are in the girl scout.
Therefore, 120 - 80 = 40 girls are not in the girl scout.

answer:  To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept.

James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept. Harry slept 9 hours, so:

James's sleep = (2/3) * 9 hours = 6 hours

Now, we subtract James's sleep from Harry's sleep to find the difference:

Difference in sleep = Harry's sleep - James's sleep
Difference in sleep = 9 hours - 6 hours
Difference in sleep = 3 hours

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

answer:  When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Therefore, the 32 ounces of sauce came from 64 ounces of tomatoes. 

Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. So, to find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of each can:

64 ounces of tomatoes / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes in her last batch of tomato sauce.

After giving away the plants, she will remain with:

18 + 80 - 40 = 58 potted plants.

answer:  The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles. To find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles, we divide the total distance by the rate of coverage:

42 miles / 3 miles per segment = 14 segments

Since each segment takes 10 minutes to cover, we multiply the number of segments by the time per segment:

14 segments * 10 minutes per segment = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take the fog bank 140 minutes to cover the entire 42-mile-wide city.

He wanted to make twice as many as he did last year, so he wanted to make 2x cookies.

He actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He dropped 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 cookies left.

Solving for x, we get 2x = 100, so x = 50.

To find the average, we add the number of roll-ups they both ate and divide by 2.
So, the average is (48 roll-ups + 42 roll-ups) / 2 = 90 roll-ups / 2 = 45 roll-ups.
Therefore, on average, they ate 45 roll-ups.

The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
