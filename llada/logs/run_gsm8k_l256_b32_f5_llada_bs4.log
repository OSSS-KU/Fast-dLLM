She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.
She bakes 4 her for her friends every day, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.
She sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, so she makes 9 * $2 = $<<18=18>>18 every day.
Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

answer:  The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. 

To find the total number of bolts, we add the amount of blue fiber to the amount of white fiber:

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: half of 2 bolts, which is 1 bolt

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
Total bolts = 2 bolts + 1 bolt
Total bolts = 3 bolts

Therefore, the robe takes a total of 3 bolts.

answer:  John runs 60 miles a week.
He runs 3 days a week, so he runs a total of 60/3 = 20 miles per day.
He runs 3 hours the first day, so he runs a total of 20/3 = 6 miles per hour.
He runs half as much the other two days, so he runs 20/2 = 10 miles per day.
Therefore, he runs a total of 10+10 = 20 miles per day.
He runs 6 miles per hour.

answer:  If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 3 x 2 = 6 miles per hour.
If she spends one-third of the time running, then she can run 6 x (1/3) = 2 miles in six hours.
If she spends two-thirds of the time walking, then she can walk 6 x (2/3) = 4 miles in six hours.
Therefore, in total, Dana can travel 2 miles + 4 miles = <<2+4=6>>6 miles in six hours.

answer:  When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Therefore, she can throw the javelin for a distance of 3 * 400 feet = 1200 feet.

The dragon's flames can reach a distance of 1000 feet. So, if holding the gemstone, Polly could stand 1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon.

One pound of beeswax costs $10.00, so 2 pounds will cost 2 * $10 = $20.
If Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, selling 20 candles will bring in 20 * $2 = $40.

The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and lost:

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of rings from each occurrence:

To find out how many hours James slept, we multiply Harry's sleep by 2/3:
James's sleep = 9 hours * 2/3 = 6 hours

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James's sleep from Harry's sleep:
Difference = Harry's sleep - James's sleep
Difference = 9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

answer:  A watermelon costs 3*15 = 45
An orange costs 45-5 = 40
Dillon is to buy 4 watermelons which cost 4*45 = 180
He is also to buy 20 peppers which cost 20*15 = 300
And he is to buy 10 oranges which cost 10*40 = 400
In total, he has to pay 180+300+400 = 880
The answer is 880

answer:  First find the total revenue from the patients: 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000
Then find the total cost to the doctors: 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000
Then subtract the cost to the doctors from the revenue from the patients to find the profit: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

answer:  First, calculate the number of elves who quit after children vomit on them:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them, leaving:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Next, subtract the 10 elves who quit after kids kick their shins:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of elves left is:
\[ 30 \]

answer:  Joseph's expenditure in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May. Therefore, his expenditure in June was:

\[ 500 - 60 = 440 \]

To find the total expenditure for both May and June, we add the expenditures for both months:

\[ 500 + 440 = 940 \]

So, Joseph's total expenditure for those two months was $940.

#### 940
