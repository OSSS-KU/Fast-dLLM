answer:  Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.
She bakes 4 her for her friends every day, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.
She sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 per day.
Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

answer:  To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to add the amount of blue fiber and the amount of white fiber.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
It also takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber and the amount of white fiber:
2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts in total.

Therefore, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is 3 bolts.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = <<25-2=23>>23 jewels.

answer:  First, calculate the points Mike scores in the second 20 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points. 

25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, add the points from both periods to find the total: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

Next, calculate how much money he spends on video games: 8 video games * $20/video, game = $160

Now, determine how much money he has left after buying the video games: $195 - $160 = $35

Since he has $5 left, this means he didn't buy any more lego sets, so he still has 13 lego sets.

He runs 3 days a week, so he runs 60/3 = 20 miles per day.
He runs 3 hours the first day, so he runs 20/3 = 10 miles per hour.
He runs half as much the other two days, so he runs 20/2 = 10 miles per day.
Therefore, he runs 10 miles per hour + 10 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour on the other two days.

One pound of beeswax costs $10.00, so 2 pounds will cost 2 * $10 = $20.
If Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, selling 20 candles will bring in 20 * $2 = $40.

answer:  For the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup/day x 180 days = 180 cups of dog food.
For the remaining 180 days, the puppy needs 2 cups/day x 180 days = 360 cups of dog food.
In total, the puppy needs 180 cups + 360 cups = 540 cups of dog food in one year year.
Therefore, Cecilia will need 500 cups / 110 cups = 5 bags of dog food.

answer:  The original cost of the grooming is $100. The groomer offers a 30% discount. To find the discounted price, we first calculate the amount of the discount:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final cost:

\[ \text{Final cost} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

So, the grooming cost is $70.

To find out how many hours James slept, we multiply Harry's sleep by 2/3:
James's sleep = 9 hours * 2/3 = 6 hours

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James's sleep from Harry's sleep:
Difference = Harry's sleep - James's sleep
Difference = 9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

answer:  On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so there were 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.
On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30, so the number of vehicles added on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20.
Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers added on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.
Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4 ( - 2) = 4.

answer:  Four years ago, Adrien earned $40000.
Four years later, Adrien earned $40000 + 40% of $40000 = $56000.
Four years ago, Lylah earned $40000 - 30% of $40000 = $38000.
Four years later, Lylah earned $56000 - 30% of $56000 = $44800.

answer:  Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad contains 30 sheets. Therefore, he uses:

\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Assuming there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, Miguel uses:

\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 240 \text{ sheets} \]

So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

answer:  Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, for a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.
Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.
So, Kael brought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.
In total, they have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.

answer:  Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less each day, so she slept 8 - 2 = 2 * 2 = 6 hours each day.
On Thursday and Friday, she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.
In total, Sadie slept 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 = <<8+6+6+7+7=34>>34 hours throughout the week.

answer:  First, calculate the distance Rosie runs in the first 3 hours: 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = <<10*3=30>>30 miles

Next, calculate the distance she runs in the remaining 4 hours: 5 miles/hour * 4 hours = <<5*4=20>>20 miles

Finally, add the distances from both parts of her run to find the total distance she runs in 7 hours: 30 miles + 20 miles = <<30+20=50>>50 miles

answer:  Firstie, determine how many letters Jennie stamped:
Jennie put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps:
60 letters * 1/3 = 20 letters

Next, subtract the number of stamped letters from the total number of letters needing stamps:
60 letters - 20 letters = 40 letters

Now, add the number of letters currently in the already-stamped pile to the number of letters that were not stamped:
40 letters + 30 letters = 70 letters

The final answer is 70 letters.

answer:  Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew and then had 5 more spoons from her husband, making a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 3 + 5 = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x + 8 = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 8 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Julia bought 4 spoons.

answer:  Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He also bought 6 more than chicken sausages, which means he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

To find the total number of sausages, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages:

38 + 44 = 82

So, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages.

82 sausages

An orange costs 45-5 = 40
Dillon is to buy 4 watermelons which cost 4*45 = 180
He also is to buy 20 peppers which cost 20*15 = 300
And he is to buy 10 oranges which cost 10*40 = 400
In total, he has to spend 180+300+400 = 880

answer:  First find the total revenue from the patients: 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient * 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000
Then find the total cost to the doctors: 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000
Then subtract the cost to the doctors from the revenue from the patients to find the profit: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

answer:  First, calculate the number of elves who quit after children vomit on them:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them, leaving:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Next, subtract the 10 elves who quit after kids kick their shins:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of elves left is:
\[ 30 \]

answer:  Joseph's expenditure in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May. Therefore, his expenditure in June was:

\[ 500 - 60 = 440 \]

To find the total expenditure for both May and June, we add the expenditures for both months:

\[ 500 + 440 = 940 \]

So, Joseph's total expenditure for those two months was $940.
