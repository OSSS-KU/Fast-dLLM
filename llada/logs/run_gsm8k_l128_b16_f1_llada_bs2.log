answer:  Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

The remaining eggs are 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

She sells these eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, she makes 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18 per day.

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

answer:  The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. 

First, calculate the amount of white fiber:
- Half of 2 bolts of blue fiber is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Next, add the amount of blue fiber to the amount of white fiber:
- Blue fiber: 2 bolts
- White fiber: 1 bolt

Total bolts of fiber:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \]

So, the robe takes a total of 3 bolts of fiber to make.

The profit is the difference between the new value and the original price, so it is $195,000 - $80,000 = $115,000.

On the first day, each train travels 80 miles westward.
On the second day, each train travels 150 miles northward.

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:

80 miles (first day) + 150 miles (second day) = 230 miles

Therefore, each train covers a total distance of 230 miles in the two days.

answer:  John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he earns 13 * $15 = $195.
He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends 8 * $20 = $160.
He has $5 left after buying the video games, so he spent $195 - $160 - $5 = $30 on video games.
Since he spent $30 on video games, he still has $30 / $15 = 2 lego sets left.

Next, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces:

So, the two girls together got 4 + 4 = 8 liters of water.
The boy got 6 liters of water.
The total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is 8 + 6 = 14 liters.
Therefore, the amount of water left is 24 - 14 = 10 liters.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of stickers Charlie had initially: 10 stickers.

Next, add the stickers he bought: 21 stickers + 10 stickers = 31 stickers.

Then, add the stickers he received for his birthday: 23 stickers + 31 stickers = 54 stickers.

Subtract the stickers he gave to his sister: 54 stickers - 9 stickers = 45 stickers.

Subtract the stickers he used to decorate a greeting card: 45 stickers - 28 stickers = 7 stickers.

answer:  Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. 

First, calculate Alex's weight:
4 times Grace's weight = 4 * 125 = 500 pounds
Alex's weight = 500 - 2 = 498 pounds

Now, find their combined weights:
Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 pounds + 498 pounds = 623 pounds

So, their combined weights together are 623 pounds.

answer:  Let's denote the number of games lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games won is \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team won \( 15 \) games.

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James's sleep from Harry's sleep:

Given that the volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, the original volume of the tomatoes must be 32 / 2 = 16 ounces.

Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, Freda used 16 / 16 = 1 can of tomatoes.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, Freda used 3 tomatoes.

Cross-multiplying gives:

answer:  Rosie runs 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so she runs 10 * 3 = 30 miles in the first 3 hours.
After 3 hours, she runs 5 miles per hour for the remaining 7 - 3 = 4 hours.
So, she runs 5 * 4 = 20 miles in the remaining 4 hours.
In total, Rosie runs 30 + 20 = 50 miles in 7 hours.

answer:  First, determine how many letters Jennie stamps: 60 letters * 1/3 = <<60*1/3=20>>20 letters

Next, subtract the number of letters she stamps from the total number of letters needing stamps: 60 letters - 20 letters = <<60-20=40>>40 letters

Now, subtract the number of letters already in the pile-stamped letters from the total: 40 letters - 30 letters = 40 letters - 30 letters = 10 letters

answer:  Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

Julia's husband gave her 5 spoons, and she used 3 spoons to sample the stew. After using these spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package of spoons that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

answer:  Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He also bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. To find the number of fish sausages, we add 6 to the number of chicken sausages:

\[ 38 + 6 = 44 \]

So, Dylan bought 44 fish sausages.

To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages:

\[ 38 + 44 = 82 \]

Therefore, Dylan bought a total of \( 82 sausages in all.

answer:  Lily made 50 friends. Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Together, Lily and Amy have 50 + 70 = 120 friends.

answer:  Each watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45.
Each orange costs 45 - 5 = 40.
Dillon will spend 4 * 45 = 180 on watermelons.
He will spend 20 * 15 = 300 on peppers.
He will spend 10 * 40 = 400 on oranges.
The total amount of money he will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880.
The answer is 880

answer:  The hospital sees 500 patients a day, so they see 500/60 = 10 hours of patient visits per day.
The hospital charges $200 per hour, so they make 10 * $200 = $2000 per day.
The doctors charge $150 per hour, so they pay 10 * $150 = $1500 per day.
The hospital's profit is $2000 - $1500 = $500 per day.
Solution: 500

answer:  First, we need to determine how many elves quit after children vomit on them. A third of the 60 elves quit:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

So, 20 elves quit, leaving:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30.

answer:  To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we need to add his expenditures for each month.

Joseph's expenditure in May was $500.
In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May, so his expenditure in June was:

$500 - $60 = $440

Now, we add the expenditures for May and June to find the total expenditure:

$500 + $440 = $940

Therefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June was:

$940.
